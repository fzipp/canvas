This Go module uses WebSockets to communicate with a
[2D canvas graphics context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)
in a web browser.
It offers a portable way to create interactive 2D graphics from within
a Go program.

The Go program (server) sends draw commands to the web browser (client) via
WebSocket using a binary format.
The client in return sends keyboard, mouse and touch events to the server.

The module does not require operating system specific backends or Cgo bindings.
It does not use WebAssembly, which means the Go code runs on the server side,
not in the browser.
The client-server design means the canvas can be displayed on a different
machine over the network.

## Examples

The [example](example) subdirectory contains several demo programs.

## Usage

### Drawing

The `ListenAndServe` function initializes the canvas server and takes the
following arguments: the network address with the port number to bind to, a
run function, and an options structure, that configures various aspects
such as the canvas size in pixels, or a title for the browser tab.

The `run` function is called when a client connects to the server.
This is the entry point for drawing.

```go
package main

import (
	"image/color"
	"log"

	"github.com/fzipp/canvas"
)

func main() {
	err := canvas.ListenAndServe(":8080", run, &canvas.Options{
		Title:  "Example 1: Drawing",
		Width:  100,
		Height: 80,
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

func run(ctx *canvas.Context) {
	ctx.SetFillStyle(color.RGBA{R: 200, A: 255})
	ctx.FillRect(10, 10, 50, 50)
	// ...
	ctx.Flush()
}
```

After the program has been started, the canvas can be accessed by
opening http://localhost:8080 in a web browser.

The server does not immediately send each drawing operation to the client,
but buffers them until the `Flush` method gets called.
The flush should happen once the image, or an animation frame is complete.
Without a flush nothing gets displayed.

Each client connection starts its own run function as a goroutine. Access to
shared state between client connections must be synchronized. If you do not
want to share state between connections you should keep it local to the run
function and pass the state to other functions called by the run function.

### An animation loop

You can create an animation by putting a `for` loop in the `run` function.
Within this loop the `ctx.Events()` channel should be observed for a
`canvas.CloseEvent` to exit the loop when the connection is closed.

A useful pattern is to create a struct that holds the animation state and
has an update and a draw method:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"time"

	"github.com/fzipp/canvas"
)

func main() {
	err := canvas.ListenAndServe(":8080", run, &canvas.Options{
		Title:  "Example 2: Animation",
		Width:  800,
		Height: 600,
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

func run(ctx *canvas.Context) {
	d := &demo{}
	for {
		select {
		case event := <-ctx.Events():
			if _, ok := event.(canvas.CloseEvent); ok {
				return
			}
		default:
			d.update()
			d.draw(ctx)
			ctx.Flush()
			time.Sleep(time.Second / 6)
		}
	}
}

type demo struct {
	// Animation state, for example:
	x, y int
	// ...
}

func (d *demo) update() {
	// Update animation state for the next frame
	// ...
}

func (d *demo) draw(ctx *canvas.Context) {
	// Draw the frame here, based on the animation state
	// ...
}
```

### Keyboard, mouse and touch events

In order to handle keyboard, mouse and touch events you have to specify which
events the client should observe and send to the server.
This is done by passing an `EnabledEvents` option to the `ListenAndServe`
function.
Mouse move events typically create more WebSocket communication than the
others.
So you may want to enable them only if you actually use them.

The `ctx.Events()` channel receives the observed events, and a type switch
determines the specific event type.
A useful pattern is a `handle` method dedicated to event handling:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/fzipp/canvas"
)

func main() {
	err := canvas.ListenAndServe(":8080", run, &canvas.Options{
		Title:  "Example 3: Events",
		Width:  800,
		Height: 600,
		EnabledEvents: []canvas.Event{
			canvas.MouseDownEvent{},
			canvas.MouseMoveEvent{},
			canvas.TouchStartEvent{},
			canvas.TouchMoveEvent{},
			canvas.KeyDownEvent{},
		},
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

func run(ctx *canvas.Context) {
	d := &demo{}
	for !d.quit {
		select {
		case event := <-ctx.Events():
			d.handle(event)
		default:
			d.update()
			d.draw(ctx)
			ctx.Flush()
		}
	}
}

type demo struct {
	quit bool
	// ...
}

func (d *demo) handle(event canvas.Event) {
	switch e := event.(type) {
	case canvas.CloseEvent:
		d.quit = true
	case canvas.MouseDownEvent:
		// ...
	case canvas.MouseMoveEvent:
		// ...
	case canvas.TouchStartEvent:
		// ...
   	case canvas.TouchMoveEvent:
		// ...
   	case canvas.KeyDownEvent:
		// ...
	}
}

func (d *demo) update() {
	// ...
}

func (d *demo) draw(ctx *canvas.Context) {
	// ...
}
```

Note that the `canvas.CloseEvent` does not have to be explicitly enabled.
It is always enabled.
